                tempo, the song maintains an upbeat and intense rhythm, capturing a sense 
                of urgency and determination. The background melody is predominantly 
                conjunct, with smooth progressions that provide a stable base, while the 
                vocal lines are more disjunct, adding dramatic leaps and phrasing to convey 
                emotional depth. Musically, the track uses consonance to establish a groove

                layers adds tension, amplifying themes of resilience. Lyrically, the song 
                explores survival, ambition, and loyalty, with the "safehouse" metaphor 
                symbolizing a refuge or secure mindset amidst life's chaos. This mix of 
                compelling lyrics and dynamic production has made it a standout 
                piece in BigXthaPlug's discography
