                Big X, also known as Xavier Landum, had a life that was anything but ordinary 
                before his rise to fame as a rapper. Growing up in Dallas, Texas, he faced 
                adversity from a young age, witnessing his mother defend their home with a gun 
                during a robbery when he was just a child. This traumatic experience, along 
                with a challenging upbringing, shaped his tough exterior and street-smart 
                mentality. His athletic prowess earned him a football scholarship to Crown 
                College in Minnesota, but his time there was cut short due to legal troubles 
                stemming from drug dealing. It was during his incarceration that he discovered 
                his passion for music, using jail-issued medical forms to write his first raps. 
                This newfound talent ignited a spark within him, setting the stage 
                for his eventual transition into the world of hip-hop.

                Big X The Plug worked to put his name on the map, but that wasn't the only 
                thing rapping did for him. Much of his music describes how his fame and wealth 
                have helped his family grow. His music was created for him and his people, 
                with multiple instances of him asking for a verse so that other members of his 
                group could make a name for himself. Similarly the song "Texas" was selected 
                by his people, though Big X himself thought it needed work. Big X's music, 
                though carrying a strong or boastful pace, has room for his 
                generosity and love to come forward.
